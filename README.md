# Map_ol4

This project is just a minor project to show what I have worked on during the last 6 months as a junior web developer at Buchanan Computing.


The real project name is **Traffweb** and as a sole developer in the company I was in charge of the new project upgrade.

For the interface I switch from old technologies like Jquery Mobile, Jquery UI and ThemeRoller with modern ones like Bootstrap.

Here the comparison between the old and new interface for Desktop and Mobile; previously there was 2 versions, a mobile and a desktop version, with the new design I developed a progressive web app.

Here the old version

and here the new version

Speaking about the mapping framework I rewritten almost the whole JS code used with OpenLayers2 and Jquery Mobile with OpenLayers4; the migration to OpenLayers4 required me a lot of time as between the 2 versions, the core is completely different and the approach to solve the same problem are different.
